# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are currently supporting version 1.x* with security updates.
Unit tests are on their way and the package will be stable up to the next major version change.
After major version change, the previous major version will be supported for the next 3 months, after which we will cease with support for the earlier version and continue with the new major ver.

The major version change is only expected to happen if something changes in the AT fiscalization law.
Everything else is a minor version for fixing and providing security/bug fixes.
